    The AFTCalculator is a modern, interactive tool designed to help soldiers, trainers, and fitness enthusiasts accurately calculate their Army Combat Fitness Test (AFT) scores. Drawing on official Department of Defense scoring tables, this calculator supports all five AFT events: 3 Repetition Maximum Deadlift (MDL), Hand Release Push-Up - Arm Extension (HRP), Sprint-Drag-Carry (SDC), Plank (PLK), and Two-Mile Run (2MR). Simply select your gender, age group, and MOS, then enter your event results using intuitive sliders and unit selectors. The tool instantly displays your event scores, total score, and pass/fail status, along with a radar chart for visual comparison against minimum standards.
